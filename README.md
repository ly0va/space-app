# Launch.io

An app our team made for NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2018. It's purpose is to provide accessible rocket launch information for everyone.
**Try it out [here](https://launchio-932961e1943e.herokuapp.com/).**

## Overview

At the top of main page you can find some details about the next flight.

It is also possible to read information about a particular spaceport by clicking on it's marker on the map. The bigger the circle, the more launches will be done from this locatin. All launch descriptions can be found below the map.

Another feature is the ability to filter launches by time period, which can be chosen by picking two dates on the calendar above the map. 

At the top right corner two links are located. The first one shows information about the reasons when and where a rocket will be launched and why a flight can be cancelled. 

The second one links to the list of active rockets and some useful description.
